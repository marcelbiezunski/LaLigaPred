# LALIGA MATCH OUTCOME PREDICTION MODEL

Developed a predictive model to estimate the chances of a LaLiga teamâ€™s victory using Random Forest algorithm. Performed feature engineering an data normalization to enhance model performance. Integrated a rolling average technique to smooth out fluctuations in team performance over time, helping to capture underlying trends and improve model accuracy. 

"laliga_predictor1" operates using data from seasons 2023-2025 (matches.csv), while "laligapredfull" is based on data from seasons 2019-2025 (matches_full.csv).

Additionally, there is the "myscrap.ipynb" program, which is responsible for web scraping match data from the website: "https://fbref.com/en/comps/12/La-Liga-Stats".
"myscrap.ipynb" can be easily adjusted to fetch data by selecting different seasons or even teams.
